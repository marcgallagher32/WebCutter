# Web-Based Video Editing App Checklist

This checklist outlines the features and tasks required to build a web-based video editing application with a dark theme, soft retro colors, and an 80's retro vibe. The app is designed to automate repetitive tasks in video editing, particularly for YouTube content creation, while supporting large video files (2-3 hours) and future AI-driven features.

## Project Setup

- [ ] Choose a front-end framework (React or Vue.js)
- [ ] Set up the project structure
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (e.g., FFmpeg.js for video processing, Konva.js for timeline if using)
- [ ] Configure development environment (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Set up version control (Git)

---

## UI Design

- [ ] Implement a dark theme with soft retro colors (muted neons: pink, blue, green, purple)
- [ ] Select retro-inspired fonts and icons (e.g., pixelated or softened 80's typefaces)
- [ ] Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- [ ] Create reusable UI components (buttons, panels, icons) with retro styling
- [ ] Add subtle glow effects, gradients, and rounded edges for an 80's vibe
- [ ] Ensure high contrast for readability against the dark background

---

## Initial Screen

- [ ] Create a clean, simple UI with buttons for:
  - Loading a video file (MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV)
  - Loading an XML or FCPXML file
  - Opening a previously saved project
- [ ] Add a list of recent projects for quick access
- [ ] Style buttons and text with retro colors and typography
- [ ] Use plenty of white space and minimal clutter
- [ ] Implement a dark background with soft neon accents

---

## Full Editing Interface

- [ ] Create a menu bar at the top with:
  - File options: Save, Export Video, Export XML/FCPXML
  - Edit options: Undo, Redo
  - View options: Toggle panels (e.g., text-based editing)
  - Settings: Customize preferences (e.g., keyboard shortcuts)
- [ ] Implement collapsible tool panels on the left for:
  - Media bin (imported clips and assets)
  - Editing tools (trim, cut, etc.)
  - Text-based editing (toggleable)
- [ ] Add a video feed in the center/right with retro-styled playback controls:
  - Play (spacebar shortcut)
  - Stop
  - Rewind (e.g., 5 seconds)
  - Fast Forward (e.g., 5 seconds)
- [ ] Build the timeline at the bottom with:
  - Horizontal video and audio tracks
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for clips
  - Zoom in/out and scroll for precision
  - Visual markers for cuts and transitions
  - Retro-colored waveforms and clip borders
- [ ] Include a toggle button for the text-based editing panel
- [ ] Add icons to link/unlink audio from video clips (e.g., a neon chain icon)

---

## Video Import/Export

- [ ] Integrate FFmpeg.js for in-browser video processing
- [ ] Support importing video formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV
- [ ] Provide export options for MP4 and MOV with resolution choices (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- [ ] Implement chunked processing or proxy files for handling large videos (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Add progress bars for file imports and exports with retro animations

---

## XML/FCPXML Support

- [ ] Develop parsers to import XML and FCPXML files
- [ ] Map imported data (clips, timelines, metadata) to the app's internal structure
- [ ] Implement export functionality for XML and FCPXML formats
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with other editing software (e.g., Final Cut Pro)

---

## Basic Editing Tools

- [ ] Add trimming functionality:
  - Drag handles or timestamp inputs to shorten clips
- [ ] Implement cutting (splitting) clips at specific points
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop arranging of clips on the timeline
- [ ] Use HTML5 Canvas or WebGL for smooth visual feedback during edits

---

## Audio Management

- [ ] Allow adding, removing, and adjusting audio tracks (e.g., music, voiceovers)
- [ ] Implement volume control, fade in/out, and mute options
- [ ] Support multiple audio tracks
- [ ] Ensure audio syncs with video clips when linked
- [ ] Use the Web Audio API for real-time audio manipulation

---

## Timeline Interface

- [ ] Build the timeline using HTML5 Canvas or Konva.js
- [ ] Display video and audio tracks horizontally with clear separation
- [ ] Add zoom in/out functionality for precision editing
- [ ] Implement snapping for clip alignment
- [ ] Show visual markers for cuts, transitions, and J-cuts
- [ ] Include a playhead for scrubbing through the timeline
- [ ] Add a retro grid or pattern in the background for an 80's sci-fi look

---

## Automatic Batch J-Cutting

- [ ] Develop an algorithm to apply J-cuts across the entire timeline
- [ ] Allow users to set J-cut duration (e.g., 2 seconds)
- [ ] Provide an option to skip specific transitions
- [ ] Adjust audio offsets for linked clips without unlinking them
- [ ] Enable manual fine-tuning of J-cuts after batch application

---

## Text-Based Editing

- [ ] Set up a local server (e.g., Node.js) to bridge the app and a local Whisper installation
- [ ] Implement transcription of video audio using Whisper
- [ ] Display transcription in a toggleable panel with retro styling
- [ ] Support multiple speakers in the transcription
- [ ] Sync text edits (e.g., delete, rearrange) with timeline adjustments using timestamps
- [ ] Add a check to detect if Whisper is installed locally and provide setup guidance if not

**Note:** For public release, include easy installation instructions for Whisper.

---

## Future AI Features

- [ ] Plan for script-based take selection:
  - Upload a script and use AI to select the best take for each line
  - Criteria: energetic pace, closeness to script, no fumbling, clarity
- [ ] Design for multi-actor scene assembly:
  - Arrange best takes in script order, handling improvisation contextually
- [ ] Consider cloud-based or local AI models for processing

**Note:** AI features are for future implementation and not part of the initial build.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement proxy files for editing large videos (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Use chunked processing for video imports to manage memory
- [ ] Optimize rendering and playback performance in the browser
- [ ] Ensure smooth timeline interactions with large projects

---

## Testing and Browser Support

- [ ] Test the app on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
- [ ] Ensure consistent performance and compatibility across browsers
- [ ] Validate functionality with large video files (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify Whisper integration and transcription accuracy

---

## Additional Notes

- **Whisper Integration**: Requires a local Whisper installation. The app should detect if it's installed and guide the user if not.
- **AI Features**: Planned for future phases; focus on core functionality first.
- **Monetization**: Initially for personal use, with potential for open-sourcing or selling later.
- **Accessibility**: Not a current focus but can be added later if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration is not required but noted for future consideration.
